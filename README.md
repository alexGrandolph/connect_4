**This game of Connect 4 is from the brain trust that brought you [individual] War and Peace [projects].  Industry titans Andrew Speth and Alex Randolph have developed an innovative adaption of the classic childhood game Connect 4, playable directly from your computers terminal.  With a combined 4 weeks of experience coding with Ruby, Andrew Speth and Alex Randolph are stalwarts of the Ruby and the coding community at large.  Both developers started from humble begginings, starting their journey at the esteemed Turing School of Software and Design.  While at this prodigious institute, both gentlemen received precious instruction from the world renowned @mod-1-squad-be. The iconic Professor T, the legendary Chris Simmons, and world famous Meg Stang were instrumental in guiding Andrew and Alex towards this momentous project.

***Andrew Speth and Alex Randolph designed a complex algorithmic AI, known as 'connect4-tron', to compete against any human brave enough.  This AI uses a custom made complex 'randomization' model to select where to place its piece, occasionally blocking the human players next move and even winning sometimes.  The game as a whole utilizes numerous complex conditional structures to determine horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins, relaying play by play updates of the game board to the user, and a vast and immersive menu system.
